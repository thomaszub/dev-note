# Scrum

This note is about the Scrum framework

## Three empircal pillars

The three pillars are based on empiricism and lean thinking. 

### Transparency

Transparency reveals the state of the work and enables inspection to be of value. If the perceived state is intransparent, it will lead to a inprecise perceived state resulting in lower value and higher risk.

### Inspection

The work has to be inspected frequently to be able to adjust accordingly in the case of deviations and problems. Inspection enables adaption.

### Adaption

In the occurrence of deviations or problems in the process and work the team has to adapt fast to minimize further problems. To adapt fast, a team has to be self-managing. 

## Five values

The member of the Scrum team should act accordingly to the five values empowering their team work.

* Commitment
* Focus
* Openness
* Respect
* Courage

## Events

Five events are practised in Scrum:

* Sprint
* Sprint Planning
* Daily Scrum
* Sprint Review
* Sprint Retrospective

## Artifacts

Three artifacts represent value or work in Scrum and each is commited to one goal:

* Product Backlog -> Product Goal
* Spring Backlog -> Sprint Goal
* Increment -> Definition of Done
