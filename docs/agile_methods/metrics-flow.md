# Flow metrics

This note is about the metrics of work item flow.

## Basic flow metrics

There are four basic flow metrics

* Work in Progress - Work items that are started but not finished
* Cycle time - Elapsed time between start and end of a work item
* Work item age - Elapsed time between start of a work item and the current time
* Throughput - Number of work items finished per unit of time

# Little's law

Little's law states that the following relationship holds:

\[
\operatorname{average cycle time} = \frac{\operatorname{average work in progress}}{\operatorname{average throughput}}
\]
